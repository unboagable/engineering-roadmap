# Getting Started

Getting started might be daunting but there are plenty of resources and online communities to support and encourage your development

Are you curious about

* How to code? What's the difference between code, software, programing?
* Example
  * how do we get from 1's and 0's to pictures, video games, zip files?
  * how to code a text editor from scratch

...you are in the right place

## Guide

* take courses, a good place to start is this [roadmap](https://roadmap.sh/)
  * these [courses](https://github.com/unboagable/software-engineering-roadmap/blob/master/Getting%20Started.md#courses) should give you an idea
    * ideally you need a class in data structures, algorithms, and a programming class
    * try coding data structures, algorithms, or experiment with the concepts yourself
